## Welcome to my own little plain of Oblivion! ü™ê

My name is Mateus Begnini Melchiades and I am a developer and researcher in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence** at iTT Chip, a semiconductor research institute at Unisinos University in S√£o Leopoldo, Brazil. I am currently majoring at the same university in **Computer Science** and expect to graduate in 2023.

I also develop apps for Apple platforms in my free time using **SwiftUI**; the current project I am working on is **PreLog**, a Toggl Client for MacOS, iOS and WatchOS.

Some of my other passions in the area are: Biotechnology, Digital tools for learning, and Data statistics.
