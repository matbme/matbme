## Welcome to my own little plane of Oblivion! ü™ê

My name is Mateus Begnini Melchiades and I am a developer and researcher in **Machine Learning** at Unisinos University in S√£o Leopoldo, Brazil. I am currently majoring at the same university in **Computer Science** and expect to graduate in 2023. My field of study is centered towards NLP and Neural Networks for health and finance applications.

When I'm not busy with school and/or work I usually ~~procastinate~~ create and contribute to open source projects mostly related to Linux and Neovim. The programming languages I usually work with are:

- Python (also Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, ...)
- C
- Lua
- Bash
- Swift

### My creations
- JABS.nvim: A minimal buffer switcher window for Neovim written in Lua.

### Projects I helped at:
- Brazilian Portuguese translator for [Agenda](https://agenda.com) app.

### Research papers I worked at:
- Co-author of "FastIoT - A Compression Model for Displaying a Huge Volume of IoT data in Web Environments" (publication pending)
- Main author of "Anticipating faults by predicting non-linearity of environment variables with neural networks: a case study in semiconductor manufacturing" (accepted for presentation at LXAI @ ICML 2021)
