## Welcome to my own little plane of Oblivion! ü™ê

My name is Mateus Begnini Melchiades and I am a developer and researcher in **Machine Learning** at Unisinos University in S√£o Leopoldo, Brazil. I am currently majoring at the same university in **Computer Science** and expect to graduate in 2023. My field of study is centered towards NLP and Neural Networks for health and finance applications.

When I'm not busy with school and/or work I usually ~~procastinate~~ create and contribute to open source projects mostly related to Linux and (Neo)vim. The programming languages I usually work with are:

- Python (also popular libraries like Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, ...)
- C
- Lua
- Bash
- Vala
- Rust
- Go

### My creations
- *JABS.nvim*: A minimal buffer switcher window for Neovim written in Lua.
- *tree-sitter-vala*: A [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) implementation for the [Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala) programming language.

### Larger projects I contribute to
- [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org) contributor: I help develop and improve system applications like ABroot and Apx, as well as GNOME-related projects for better graphical integration with the OS.

### Research papers I worked at:
- Co-author of "FastIoT - A Compression Model for Displaying a Huge Volume of IoT data in Web Environments" (publication pending)
- Main author of "Anticipating faults by predicting non-linearity of environment variables with neural networks: a case study in semiconductor manufacturing" (accepted for presentation at LXAI @ ICML 2021)
- Co-author of "MoStress: a Sequence Model for Stress Classification" in 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Padova, Italy, 2022.
